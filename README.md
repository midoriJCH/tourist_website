This is my first solo project from my self study in HTML and CSS! We were tasked with creating a tourism ad for our city and this is what I came up with. 
I'm sure there is lots of improvements and a DRYer method but for my first solo project only 20 days into my coding journey im quite proud of it.
I'll be uploading more here in the future!

Cheers,

p.s I have the project hosted, please see the website in the repo description to check it out :)
